title: Lesson 11b - Voice-leading for First and Third Inversion Chords
abc: true
---

First-inversion and third-inversion chords are used to make smoother, more melodic bass lines, but in doing so, we put tendency tones -- and all of the accompanying expectations -- into the bass. Even though this seems more restrictive, first- and third- inversion chords actually allow more freedom in part-writing because they remove the potential objectionable parallels that come from having the root in the bass.

## Resolving tendency tones

**Placing either the chordal third or chordal seventh in the bass voice not only creates more melodic bass lines, it also allows the upper voices more freedom because there is one less tendency tone to distribute and resolve correctly. Use the voicing and voice-leading guidelines discussed in the previous topic to harmonize the following progressions in an SATB style. As always, make note of any difficulties that you encounter for the class discussion.**

**Assuming that the progression follows the circle-of-fifths, what inversion must a chord be that follows a first-inversion chord? Following a third-inversion?**

## Function over form (Part 2)

**When harmonizing the short chord progressions in the previous topic, we discussed why we have to treat the vi chord in a deceptive cadence as a *functional substitute* for tonic. Because the vi chord acts as a replacement for a I chord, we double the scale degree that works best for a I chord, `do`, rather than the standard doubling of the root, `la` or fifth, `mi`. In this progression, it is correct to break standard convention and double the chordal third of the vi chord. Now that we are looking at first inversion voice-leading, we have another *functional substitution* to discuss.**
- vii<sup>o</sup> is a dominant function, so therefore functions as V<sup>7</sup> chord without its root

**Because of this, the vii<sup>o</sup> chord must follow different *doubling* rules in order to avoid poor voice-leading. With this in mind, try to harmonize the following progressions; first a simple I-V<sup>6/5</sup>-I progression, and then with an added root-position vii<sup>o</sup> chord. You will discover that:**
- the two chords have all but one pitch in common.
- resolving a root-position vii<sup>o</sup> is extremely difficult and will require one voice to make consecutive jumps of a P5 to avoid issues due to tendency tone resolutions.**

{% include abc-example.html number="2" abc=ex2 %}

**Because the root position vii<sup>o</sup> triad is so difficult, it is rarely used. It is not possible to resolve a root-position vii<sup>o</sup> triad to a I chord without creating at least one unacceptable part-writing error. A root-position vii<sup>o</sup> must either pass through another chord or be inverted to resolve directly to I.**

**As a general rule of thumb, any diminished chord (including the ii<sup>o</sup> in minor) will typically need to have the chordal third doubled, because the tension of the diminished fifth and its tendency tones.**

## Function over form (Part 3)

**The pre-dominant function presents an issue that the functional substitutions in tonic and dominant functions do not. To this point, we have considered the circle-of-fifths as the voice-leading foundation for diatonic harmony. In this case, the ii chord would be the "primary" pre-dominant function, and in many ways, this is true. The IV chord, however, holds a special place in harmony because of its role as the *subdominant* -- the opposite pole of the dominant -- as well as the high frequency throughout history of the I-IV-V-I progression.**

**Generally speaking, root position ii chords and root position IV chords are equally strong and follow standard doubling conventions. When the ii chord is in first inversion, however, it becomes a functional substitution for a root-position IV chord. This means that a ii<sup>6</sup> chord most often takes its doubling from a root-position IV chord. (In the same way that a vii<sup>o</sup> chord takes its doubling from a V<sup>7</sup> chord.) Try this on the following progressions. (Make sure to consider the common direction and motion for upper voices tend to do when a root position IV chord moves to a V chord.)**

## Passing chords

**When a chord is inserted between two other chords to create a bass line with stepwise motion, we call this a *passing chord*. First- and third-inversion chords often function in this way. You can consider *passing* a function that replaces a chord's standard function (i.e. tonic, dominant, and predominant), and instead extends the function of the chords on either side. In the following example, notice that the V<sup>6</sup> chord has a doubled third, and if it were to resolve directly to a I chord, it would create parallel octaves. In this case, the IV<sup>6</sup> chord in no longer strictly a pre-dominant function, because it's primary role in this case is to extend the dominant function to allow the V<sup>6</sup> to fix its doubling before resolving to a tonic chord. Harmonize the following progression to practice using a passing chord.**

## Conclusions

### Voice-Leading for First and Third Inversion Chords 

First inversion chords make tendancy tones the top priority.
First inversion chords put the chordal third in the bass, which locks you in to resolving the bass line a cetrain way. 

The third wants to resolve down to the root of the next chord. 
The seventh wants to resolve down to the third of the next chord. 

First inversion triads want to resolve to the next chord in root position. 
Third inversion seventh chords want to resolve to a first inversion of the next chord. 

#### Example: 

Lead Sheet: C - G/B - C - C - G7/F - C/E

Soprano: C5 - D5 - C5 - C5 - D5 - C5

Alto: E4 - F4 - E4 - E4 - G4 - G4

Tenor: G3 - G3 - G3 - G3 - B3 - C4

Bass: C3 - B2 - C3 - C3 - F3 - E3

Roman Numerals: I - V6/5 - I - I - V4/2 - I6

First and third inversion chords are meant to make the bassline more melodic and enjoyable to sing. 

### VII Diminished Chords

Your ear hears it as either wanting to resolve inward by halfstep or outward by halfstep depending on what you hear.
If you hear a tritone as an augmented 4th, it wants to resolve outward.
If you hear a tritone as a diminished 5th, it wants to resolve inward.

VII Diminished chords (viio) do not double the root in 4-part voicing. 
  - both Ti's will want to resolve to Do
    - that creates part writing errors
    
If you're ever questioning your doubling in a viio, think of how you would voice the chord if it were a V7.
A viio has the top three notes of a V7. 

#### Example: Using viio as a dominant function. 
Get a viio to a V6/5 in C major.

Lead Sheet: C - G7/B - C - C - Bo - G7/B - C

Soprano: C5 - D5 - C5 - C5 - D5 - D5 - C5

Alto: E4 - F4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - F4 - E4

Tenor: G3 - G3   G3 - G3 - F4 - G4 - G4

Bass: C3 - B2 - C3 - C3 - B2 - B2 - C3 

Roman Numerals: I - V6/5 - I - I - viio - V6/5 - I

The movement of the tenor voice from F to G breaks the rule of resolving tendancy tones.
It doesn't allow Fa to resolve down to Mi.
Using a viio as a dominant function is uncommon because of the difficulties in voice leading. 

### Pre-Dominants

Using a IV chord in a progression. 
The subdominant is the polar opposite of the dominant. 
The I - IV - V - I is a strong progression used throughout history. 
The IV does not have as strong a pull to the dominant as ii. 
BUT, the ii can be substituted as the IV. 
Tendancy tone function doesn't apply when the chord doesn't have a dominant function.

#### Example:

Lead Sheet: C - F - G - C

Soprano: C5 - C5 - B4 - C5 

Alto: E4 - E4 - D4 - E4

Tenor: G3 - A3 - G3 - G3

Bass: C3 - F2 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - IV - V - I

## Functional Substitutions

The tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant all have a second chord that functions in a similar way. 

Tonic Substitution:

If the progression goes from V - vi, the vi is functioning as a I(sub6).
  - sub replaces the root of the chord with the given scle degree
The vi functions similarly to the tonic.

Dominant Substitution:

If viio is present, it functions the same as a V7 with no root. 
The viio functions similarly to the dominant.

Pre-Dominant Substitution:

The ii and IV are equal in pre-dominant function. 
However, if the ii is in first inversion (ii6) it functions as a IV(sub6).

### Passing Chords

Passing Chords: a set of chords in which the bass line moves in passing motion

#### Example: In C

Lead Sheet: G/B - F/A - G

Soprano: G4 - A4 - B4 

ALto: D4 - F4 - G4

Tenor: B3 - C4 - D4

Bass: B2 - A2 - G2

Roman Numerals: V6 - IV6 - V

- all this parallel motion works because the chords are in first inversion
- the parallel motion is in 3rds, 4ths, and 6ths

We have a heirarchy of function. 
It goes tonic, dominant, then sub-dominant.
Passing motion extends the function of one of these by using first inversion chords.
