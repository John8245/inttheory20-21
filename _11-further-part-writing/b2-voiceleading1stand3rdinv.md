# Class Discussion

First and Third inversion chords in circle of fifths progression:

C: I, V6, I

Soprano: C, D, C  Alto: E, G, E; (another Alto): E, D, E  Tenor: G, G, G  (Bass notes found from inversions)  We have to go to D in the soprano line to avoid parallel perfect octaves with the bass, and to avoid doubling the third (which happens to be the leading tone).

C: I, V6/5, I

Soprano: C, D, C  Alto: E, F, E  Tenor: G, G, G  (Bass notes found from roman numerals and inversions)

C: I, V4/2, I6

Soprano: C, D, C  Alto: E, G, G Tenor: G, B, C  (Bass notes found from roman numerals and inversions)

Another option: Soprano: C, B, C  Alto: E, D, C  Tenor: G, G, G

Voicing a viio using functional substitution:

C: I, viio, V6/5, I

Soprano: C, D, D, C  Alto: E, D, F, E  Tenor: G, F, G, G  (Bass notes found from roman numerals and inversions)
