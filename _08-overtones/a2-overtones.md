# Class discussion

- Research in the biology world about human echolocation. Blind people can create a sense of depth perception using mouth clicks to find walls. As they practice, they likely create mouth clicks with more overtones. This makes the click easier to relocate after it bounces off of a wall.

- Intervals! P8, P5, P4, M3, m3, m3, M2, M2, M2, M2, m2

- They continue to get smaller, even the m3's and M2's are smaller than each other as they continue up the series

How do we remember the pattern?

- Memorize the interval order

- Grouping 3 then 4 then 5. 3 is root and fifth, 4 is a major minor (dominant) seventh chord, 5 is the first notes of a Lydian scale

- Phone number! +8 (543) 332-2222. Or 854-3332 with a lydian scale afterwards.

- Group in fours. From C, the first 4 imply C, the second 4 are a first inversion C dominant chord (found in the key of F), the last 4 are sol, la, ti, do, in G.
