## Class discussion

**Our error detection method, using...numbers!**
- We're looking at horizontal motion for these movement errors, so our numbers will go between the noteheads of each voice
- ID each melodic interval and write in the corresponding number between each notehead

**Using our error detection method, what are we looking for in order to ID the errors?**
- This depends on what type of error we're looking for
  - Similar: look in soprano for a skip (number of 3 or more), then check for similar motion in bass + the "landing" interval
  - Parallel: matching numbers in the same place in two lines = check to see if both voices make a P5/P8
  - Unequal fifths: we'll find these while also looking for parallel fifths. They always involve the bassline
  - Contrary: look for sets of numbers that add up to 9
- For all these methods, make sure after you have identified a potential problem that you check the type of movement that is happening

**Are V chord the only time that UU5s happen?**
- No, but they *are* the most common place they show up
- They're a problem most associated with first inversion seventh chords

**We searched for errors in the Bach example in this order:**
- Similar (S8, S5)
- Parallel + UU5 (PP8, PP5, UU5)
- Contrary (CP8, CP5)
- Sorting the errors into groups will make it a faster process overall!
