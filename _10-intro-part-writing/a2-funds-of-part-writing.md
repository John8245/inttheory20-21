# Class discussion

Polyphony? More than one line that work together but are independent

Homophony? More than one line working together and depend on each other

Steps in part writing

-**establish a key**

-find a cadence

-figure out what notes are possible for every chord

-Create a bass line (try not to start here)

-Fill in inner voices

-"Boring" melodies can be filled out with non-chord tone embellishments.
