NOTE: The full descriptions below of each type of non-chord tone are from the online textbook, *Open Music Theory*, although each has been edited to suit this textbook's terminology and purpose. If you have not had a chance to check out *Open Music Theory* in the Further Reading section from the previous units, please take the time to do so. It is a great resource!

## Non-chord tone recap

We have already covered three of the most common types of non-chord tones (NCTs): *passing tones*, *neighbor tones*, and *suspensions*. In these discussions, we identified certain characteristics that help to classify each of the non-chord tones.
- the preparation
    - type of movement used to approach the NCT
    - direction from which the NCT is approached
- the non-chord tone
    - must not be a member of the chord
- the resolution
    - type of movement used to leave the NCT
    - direction from which the NCT is left *in relation to the preparation*

By describing the motion between these three parts of an NCT, we created definitions:
- A *passing tone* (PT) is a non-chord tone which is approached by step and left by step in the same direction.
- A *neighbor tone* (NT) is a non-chord tone which is approached by step and left by step in the opposite direction.
- A *suspension* (SUS) is a non-chord tone which is approached by static motion and resolves downward by step.

## Describing non-chord tones

This information provides a methodology and framework through which we can look at all non-chord tones, but we need further language to describe the function and characteristics of any non-chord tone.
- Accented vs unaccented
    - An accented NCT occurs on a beat, and an unaccented NCT occurs on an offbeat.
    - Most types of NCTs can be either accented or unaccented, but certain NCTs, such as suspensions, can only be one or the other. (For example, suspensions can only be accented.)
- Chromatic vs diatonic
    - Diatonic NCTs use only the notes present in the key-signature whereas chromatic NCTs have an accidental.
    - All types of NCTs can be either chromatic or diatonic, although some are extremely rare (such as a chromatic suspension).
- There are other possibilities for labeling NCTs such as ascending/descending and upper/lower. These are only applicable to certain NCTs, so it is easier to discuss these labels in those contexts.
    - Passing tones can be either ascending or descending.
    - Neighbor tones can be either upper or lower.

**We will use the following simple progression as a template for demonstrating non-chord tones. Start by providing Roman numerals and leadsheet symbols.**

### Conclusions

![][passing]

A passing tone is a melodic embellishment (typically a non-chord tone) that occurs between two stable tones (typically chord tones), creating stepwise motion. *It is approached by stepwise motion and left by stepwise motion in the same direction.* The typical figure is *chord tone – passing tone – chord tone*, filling in a third (see example), but two adjacent passing tones can also be used to fill in the space between two chord tones a fourth apart. (*double passing tone*) A passing tone can be either accented (occurring on a strong beat or strong part of the beat) or unaccented (weak beat or weak part of the beat).

#### Neighbor Tone (NT)

![][neighbor]

Like the passing tone, a complete neighbor tone is a melodic embellishment that occurs between two stable tones (typically chord tones); however, a complete neighbor tone will occur between two instances of the same stable tone. *It is approached by stepwise motion and left by stepwise motion in the opposite direction.* Also like the passing tone, movement from the stable tone to the neighbor tone and back will always be by step. A complete neighbor can be either accented or unaccented, but unaccented is more common.

#### Suspension (SUS)

![][suspension]

A suspension is formed of three critical parts: the *preparation* (accented or unaccented), the *suspension* itself (accented), and the *resolution* (unaccented). The preparation is a chord tone (consonance). The suspension is *the same note* as the preparation and occurs simultaneous with a change of harmony. The suspension then resolves downward by step to the resolution, which occurs over the same harmony as the suspension. The suspension is in many respects the opposite of a syncopation: if the anticipation is an early arrival of a tone belonging to the following chord, a suspension is a lingering of a chord tone belonging to the previous chord that forces the late arrival of the new chord’s chord tone. However, in composition and improvisation, the suspension must be treated with a great deal more care than the syncopation. The most common suspensions (and their resolutions) in upper voices form the following intervallic patterns against the bass: 9–8, 7–6, 4–3. (With the exception of 9–8, the pitch class of the resolution tone should never sound in another voice simultaneous with the suspended tone.) Instead of *SUS*, it is more typical to notate the intervallic pattern in the thoroughbass figures.

## More non-chord tones

There are many other types of NCTs, and we can use our simple progression to demonstrate examples of each of them. Compare the examples below to the original progression to determine what has changed; this change is the NCT. As you do this, use the the three characteristics discussed in the overview -- preparation, NCT, and resolution -- to create a definition for each NCT. Once you have a working definition, see if the other other descriptors (such as upper/lower, ascending/descending, chromatic/diatonic, or accented/non-accented) can be applied to each NCT.

### Retardations (RET)

**Which other NCT does a retardation resemble?**

{% include abc-example.html number="3" abc=ex3 %}

#### Conclusion (RET)

![][retardation]

A retardation is essentially an upward-resolving suspension. It is almost always reserved for the final chord of a large formal division (or a movement), and it frequently appears simultaneously with a suspension (as seen in the example).

### Neighbor Groups (NG) - also called "double neighbor tones"

#### Conclusions

![](/images/embellishingTones/doubleNeighbor.png)

Like the neighbor tones, a neighbor group, also known as a double neighbor figure begins and ends on the *same* stable tone (typically a chord tone). Between those two instances of the stable tone are two embellishing tones — one a step above and the other a step below the stable tone being embellished. Though individually we may consider each of the two embellishing tones to be incomplete neighbors (below), working together in the double-neighbor figure they balance each other out and create a contiguous whole, with the overall stability of a complete neighbor. A double neighbor figure is typically unaccented.

### Appoggiaturas (APP)

### Escape tones (ET)

{% include abc-example.html number="6" abc=ex6 %}

#### Conclusions

![][appoggiatura]

An appoggiatura is a kind of incomplete neighbor tone that is accented, *approached by leap (usually up), and followed by step (usually down) in the opposite direction*.

![][escape]

An escape tone, or *echappée*, is a kind of incomplete neighbor tone that is unaccented, *approached by stepwise motion (usually up), and left by leap (usually down) in the opposite direction*.

{% include abc-example.html number="7" abc=ex7 %}

#### Conclusions

![][anticipation]

An anticipation is essentially an otherwise stable tone that comes too early. An anticipation is a non-chord tone that will occur immediately before a change of harmony, and it will be followed on that change of harmony by the same note, now a chord tone of the new harmony. Therefore, it is approached by stepwise motion and left by static motion. The static motion between the NCT and its resolution means that you may consider this related to both suspensions and retardations, although unlike suspensions and retardations, this is an unaccented NCT with static motion occurring *after* the NCT rather than before. It is typically found at the ends of phrases and larger formal units.

![](/images/embellishingTones/syncopatedNote.png)

Some theorist classify syncopated rhythmic figures as separate from anticipations, but this is more a discussion of re-articulation. For those that classify these differently, [syncopation](http://openmusictheory.com/syncopation.html) occurs when a rhythmic pattern that typically occurs on strong beats or strong parts of the beat occurs instead on weak beats or weak parts of the beat. Like the anticipation, the syncopated note is an early arrival — it tends to belong to the chord on the following beat. Unlike the anticipation, the syncopation is tied into a note in that chord; it is not rearticulated. Rather than anticipating a note in the chord that follows, a syncopation is simply an early arrival. Of course, you should consider context when making this decision as this difference is subtle, but if there is a pattern of syncopated rhythms in a passage, you could be more likely to label a syncopation.

### Pedals (PED)

**Pedals, often referred to as pedal points, most often occur in the bass voice but can occur in any voice. They can be difficult to spot if the texture is broken into arpeggiated chords, so it may be necessary to reduce a complicated texture down to block chords to more easily find the pedals.**

### Incomplete Neighbor Tone (INT)

![][INT]

The incomplete neighbor tone is an unaccented embellishing tone that is approached by leap and proceeds by step to an accented stable tone (typically a chord tone). *It is approached by a leap and left by stepwise motion in the same direction.*  Broadly speaking an incomplete neighbor tone is any embellishing tone a step away from a stable tone that proceeds or follows it (and is connected on the other side by leap), but other kinds of incomplete neighbor tones have special names and roles that follow below.
