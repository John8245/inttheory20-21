Harmonization of "Using a secondary leading-tone seventh chord"

Progression: C: I vi viio7/V V I

Soprano: C, C, C, B, C  Alto: E, E, Eb, D, E  Tenor: G, A, A, G, G  Bass notes found from roman numerals and inversions.

Creating a viio7/ii and viio6/5 of ii in C Major

viio7/ii to ii: Soprano: E, D Alto: G, F Tenor: Bb, A Bass: C#, D

viio6/5 of ii to ii: Soprano: C#, D Alto: G, F Tenor: Bb, A Bass: E, D

Utilize tendency tones to work backwards from the target chord. In this case, a D minor chord. Since E is not a tendency tone in this example, figure it last to ensure that the tendency tones resolve properly. There are not many options due to voice leading rules.

## Chord vs. Function

What is the difference between dominant chord and dominant function?
A dominant chord is the V or V7, and brings us back to the tonic. 
Function is the reason the dominant chord goes back to the tonic. 
Dominant function includes other chords.
A viio is the simplest example of a chord that shares dominant function with the V7, but we can have other chords that function as a dominant. 
A viio chord shares a dominant fuction with the V7, because it is the upper structure of a V7 chord. 

### Changing ii7 to a dominant seventh chord

Soprano: C5 - C5 - C5 - B4 - C5

Alto: E4 - E4 - F4 - G4 - E4

Tenor: G3 - A3 - A3 - B3 - G3

Bass: C3 - A2 - D3 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - vi - ii7 - V - I

- If you raise the F to an F# in the Alto line, you get a V7/V in the place of the ii7. 

Take the same example, and add a ii7 before the V7/V.

Soprano: C5 - C5 - C5 - C5 - B4 - C5

Alto: E4 - E4 - F4 - F#4 - G4 - E4

Tenor: G3 - A3 - A3 - A3 - B3 - G3

Bass: C3 - A2 - D3 - D3 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - vi - ii7 - V7/V - V - I

Now, turn the ii7 into a viio/V.

## Secondary Leading-tones

Secondary leading-tones create a viio that leads to the dominant. 
In C, the secondary dominant for V7/V is D7, and the secondary leading-tone is F#o.
Where G is our dominant, D7 (V7/V) is the dominant to G, and F#o (viio/V) is the leading-tone to G.
- this is why secondary functions are labeled as a slash over a chord
- the top chord is the function, and the bottom chord is what the chord is functioning towards

### Example in C

#### Make the ii7 a viio/V

Soprano: C5 - C5 - C5 - B4 - C5

Alto: E4 - E4 - F#4 - D4 - E4

Tenor: G3 - A3 - A3 - G3 - G3

Bass: C3 - A2 - A2 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - vi - viio/V - V - I

- Part writing for any viio is difficult. 
- Changing it to a vii%7 gives you more options to avoid part writing errors.

#### Make the ii7 a vii%7/V

Soprano: C5 - C5 - C5 - B4 - C5

Alto: E4 - E4 - E4 - D4 - E4

Tenor: G3 - A3 - F#3 - G3 - G3

Bass: C3 - A2 - A2 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - vi - vii%7/V - V - I
