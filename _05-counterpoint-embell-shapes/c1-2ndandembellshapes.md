title: Lesson 5c - 2:1 Counterpoint and Embellishing Shapes
abc: true
---

In second-species counterpoint, the counterpoint line moves in half notes against a cantus firmus in whole notes. This 2:1 rhythmic ratio leads to two new "fundamental musical problems" -- one metric and one harmonic: 
- the differentiation between *strong beats* and *weak beats*
- the introduction of the *passing tone* dissonance. 

The introduction of harmonic dissonance into second species adds to the variety of the musical texture. However, it brings a tension that must be balanced with consonance to promote tonal fusion, and it requires careful attention in order to maintain smoothness in and out of the dissonance.

If we consider first-species counterpart the most "basic" interaction between two melodies, adding this second note against a harmony also provides an opportunity to begin discussing the shapes and patterns that composers use to embellish a simple melody.  

## Goals for this topic

Use the following examples of second-species (2:1) counterpoint to develop guidelines for writing in this style. Each of the following examples is in the major mode and has the counterpoint above the cantus firmus, but be aware that these two characteristics are not indicative of all counterpoint; we are using a simplified structure as our introduction. 

**As you develop your rules for second-species counterpoint, look only at the *counterpoint (CP)* line; the *cantus firmus (CF)* was provided, so the counterpoint line was written by following the stylistic rules.**

Generally, your rules should be divided into three categories:
- Acceptable *harmonic intervals (intervals between lines)*
    - Strong beats versus weak beats
        - Are dissonances viable? If so, when?
    - Starting and ending intervals
    - Approaching the final pitch
    - Approaching and leaving perfect intervals
    - Number of times that an interval size can be used consecutively
        - Differentiate between perfect and imperfect consonances
- Acceptable *motion between lines*
    - Acceptable types of motion
- Constructing a *melodic line*
    - Length
    - Starting and ending pitches
    - Approaching the final note
    - Repeated pitches
    - Melodic intervals
        - Leaps
        - Resolutions following leaps
        - How would you describe the motion surrounding any dissonant intervals?
    - Range
    - Climax (position in melody and frequency)

## Conclusions

### Second Species Counterpoint

2nd Species brings in one key element of music that 1st species leaves out: dissonance.
  - 2nd species applies motion between two notes of the cantus firmus

Instead of a 1:1 ratio of a whole note against another whole note, we have a 2:1 ratio with 2 half notes for every whole note.

Types of beats:
- strong 
  - strong beats are on the on beat 
  - in 4/4 that would be on 1, and only on the downbeat with the cantus firmus 
- weak
  - weak beats are on the off beat, where the whole note does not directly hit, but is still carried over
  - in 4/4 the weak beat would be on beat 3
  
#### Harmonic Intervals:

Strong and Weak Beats:
- consonances on strong beats 
- dissonances are now allowed on weak beats
 
 Start a line of counterpoint with a rest on the strong beat, and a perfect interval on the weak beat moving into the rest of the line.

Dissonances:
- only on weak beats
- approached by step

Starting and Ending Intervals:
- starts on P5, P8, or unison
- ends on P5 or P8

Approaching and Leaving Perfect Intervals
- approached by parallel motion

#### Motion Between Lines

passing motion (P): motion approached by step and left by step in the same direction

neighbor motion (N): motion approached by step and left by step in the opposite direction

- these two types of motion are the only way you can use dissonant intervals in a line of counterpoint in 2nd species
- neighbor motion is only allowed for dissonances as lower neighbor motion

appogiatura (APP): motion approached by leap and left by step in the opposite direction
